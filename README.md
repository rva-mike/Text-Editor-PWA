  # Text Editor PWA - J.A.T.E. (Just Another Text Editor)

  ## Description
   This application is a text editor that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets PWA criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancies in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application functions offline and can be installed locally. 

This text editor was built upon an existing application and implements methods for getting and storing data to an IndexedDB database. It uses a package called idb, which is a lightweight wrapper around the IndexedDB API. It features a number of methods that are useful for storing and retrieving data, and is used by companies like Google and Mozilla.
